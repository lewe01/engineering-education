[Artificial Intelligence](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence) is the future of technological progress, and many platforms are adopting it. These AI-driven platforms have helped us make quick and more innovative decisions. They have also revolutionized the customer experience, the business world, and business intelligence.

A developer's productivity and efficiency are greatly affected by the complexity of the [machine learning systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/machine-learning-system) being built or managed. However, by the use of [serverless architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html), most difficulties are solved. The serverless architecture effectively handles [machine learning models](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/articles/cc-models-machine-learning/) and resource management.

Serverless does not refer to there is no real server in place. Instead, it means that a third party handles and maintains the server infrastructure, scalability adjustment, and capacity planning. Serverless architecture gives the developers ample time and energy to concentrate on [AI model training](https://insidebigdata.com/2018/10/08/ai-training-work/) rather than managing the server's infrastructure.

### Goals for Serverless Architecture for AI and ML
Apart from infrastructure maintenance and monitoring of the application, serverless machine learning has other goals.

Machine Learning systems are usually built for complex problems. They perform several tasks such as processing and preprocessing data, training, and tuning AI models. Therefore [APIs](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api) should enable smooth execution and preferably developed in [Python](https://realpython.com/tutorials/machine-learning/), which is a top-level language. The reason for choosing Python is because of its simplicity. 
Python offers concise and readable code. Its code is understandable by humans, which makes it easy to build models for machine learning.
Developers tend to spend less time on language technicalities but rather put their efforts into solving a machine learning problem.

Steady data storage and smooth message transfers with no delays should be ensured by serverless computing and AI.

Serverless should operate on [Lambda](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda), meaning a platform with a limited number of resources. It would mean with Lambda one does not need a lot of resources or either effort. Lambda lets one run the code without managing or provisioning servers.

Also one can run code for virtually any application type or back-end services with zero administration. Lambda does all these by automatically and precisely allocating compute execution power based on the incoming requests of any traffic size.

### The Benefits of Using Serverless Architecture in AI and ML
Serverless architecture gives many opportunities and provides many advantages that will make the machine learning model more efficient and smoother.

Below are the advantages of ML and serverless architecture:

- **Fair Pricing**

  Serverless architecture facilitates execution-based pricing, which means that you are billed only for the actively running services. Thus, the approach makes the pricing mode flexible and reduces the cost drastically.

- **Independent Work**

  Serverless computing and AI allow the development teams to work independently with minimal interference and delays. It is because each model is treated as a separate function. The function can be invoked at any time without disrupting the other parts of the system.

  Also, developers can apply changes, work on development or even execute the deployment independently.

- **Autoscaling**

  It allows the developer to focus on particular crucial tasks while the system automatically readjusts itself according to the scope. With Autoscaling, developers can be more flexible and make changes on the run, eliminating the need for storage prediction.

### Tips to Build Serverless Machine Learning Model

The following steps demonstrate one approach developers can use to build serverless computing and AI:

- **Collect Data**

  At this stage, information is gathered as much as possible then stored. The more information gathered, the better the ability of the ML system ability to make enhanced predictions. To avoid code imbalances, a developer should ensure that the same amount of data should be collected for each class.

- **Preprocess Data**

  This step revolves around two main aspects:

  -  *Good quality data* - The data should be thoroughly checked and irrelevant parts must be eliminated to avoid any interference in the future.
  -  *The data should not be too big* - You should adjust the size of the data so that a single instance can process the data without being overwhelmed.

- **Label Data**

  It is a crucial step yet time-consuming. In the entire timeline of the machine learning project, data labeling takes about 25% of the time. The main objective is to ensure that the model is trained on legit examples with appropriate labels.

  The labeled data shows that information pieces have been marked, and the model can predict what a developer wants.

- **Deploy the Model**

  It is the last step of the AI development process, where the system is made available for offline and online prediction. Then the developer inspects the AI Platform Prediction, where all the model versions and model resources are stored. Lastly, the developer has to connect the local model version to the models stored in the cloud.

### AI and ML Models on a Serverless Architecture Use Cases
AI has taken over today's life, making it easier by revolutionizing automation and improving the business environments.

Below are some use cases for machine learning algorithms on serverless architecture that makes the tasks easier and the data to be more precise:

- **Making customer suggestions**

  Applications that use GPS gather customer data such as location and consumer behavior to predict and provide personalized suggestions on their preferences or next purchase. AI determines the frequency of notifications and comes up with the number of suggestions that app users may tolerate and enjoy before turning them off. Thus, it enhances the user experience and assures that customers find the content helpful.

- **Risk assessment**

  AI models can be used to determine whether a given customer is financially viable to increase their purchasing power. First, the system will assess their credit history, account information, and any other requirement as appropriate. Then the system concludes whether to proceed with a transaction or freeze it until the previous bills have been covered.

- **Logistics**

  The essential parts of logistics are observing the routes and establishing traffic overloads and how they impact customers. AI assesses the routes and recommends alternatives to assist the business to make informed decisions and improve customer experience.

- **Personalized content**

  AI has brought a new way of doing market research and establishing consumer behavior. An AI model records and analyzes the choices clients make and displays their personalized content.

### Conclusion
Serverless computing makes the complicated AI development process more straightforward. However, choosing serverless architecture means handing over control of infrastructure to the third party and letting them manage and monitor it. Moreover, that's why it's advisable to choose a trusted cloud provider for the project.

The cloud provider must have handled several similar projects, with experience in hosting and handling machine learning and serverless architectures to ensure the infrastructure runs flawlessly.

Some of the popular cloud providers include [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/), among others.
